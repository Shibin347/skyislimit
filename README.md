# skyislimit

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
 I have Completed the Api Integrations, navigations,
 search and the external browsing of git repository.
 First if the internet is connected it takes us to the home where 
 the users are listed otherwise it shows "No Internet Connection".
 Then when taped on the user it takes us to the new screen where we can
 see two tabs which shows the profile and repository. In the repository if we tap
 on it, it takes us to the web browser and shows the detailed repo.
